# LSF Hybrid Cloud Repository

## Introduction
IBM® Spectrum LSF (formerly IBM® Platform™ LSF®) is a complete workload management solution for demanding HPC environments. Featuring intelligent, policy-driven scheduling and easy to use interfaces for job and workflow management, it helps organizations to improve competitiveness by accelerating research and design while controlling costs through superior resource utilization.

The repository contents focuses on how IBM Cloud is making it easy for customers using LSF to migrate their HPC workloads to IBM Cloud using the latest Generation 2 IaaS capabilities. Two use cases are explored:
1. A complete lift and shift of their on-premise HPC cluster,
2. A hybrid HPC cluster on-premise with bursting to IBM Cloud on demand.
The scripts in the repository, are provided to ease the pain for a HPC IT Administrator, by making it easy to spin up a HPC Cluster with LSF on IBM Cloud, and also how to establish connectivity with on-premise HPC cluster environment for the bursting scenarios.

## Cloud Deployment
- For IBM Cloud, the scripts that formerly resided in this repository have been replaced by links to the LSF Cloud Catalog Tile where you can easily deploy a cluster to your specifications.
- For AWS the repository contains sample code to help you take your on premises LSF cluster and extend it to the cloud.

Whichever you choose, please follow the documentation for your cloud provider.
