This directory contains all of the keys/certificates needed to setup the VPN connection.  They need to be generated before trying to setup the connection.
The following files are expected:
ca.crt      client.csr  client.ovpn  myvpn.tlsauth  server.crt
client.crt  client.key  dh2048.pem   server.conf    server.key

The instructions were derived from here:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-and-configure-an-openvpn-server-on-centos-7

Run the Step2-vpn-bring-up.yml playbook if you have not done so already.
It will stop and say the VPN config files are missing.  Use the steps below
to generate them.

1. Go to the /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa.  It will have been generated by running
the Step2-vpn-bring-up.yml playbook.

2. Edit the /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/vars file and set the following parameters:
	export KEY_COUNTRY="CA"
	export KEY_PROVINCE="ON"
	export KEY_CITY="Markham"
	export KEY_ORG="IBM"
	export KEY_EMAIL="me@myhost.mydomain"
	export KEY_CN=company.com
	export KEY_NAME=server
	export KEY_OU=IBM-Systems

   KEY_COUNTRY 	is a two letter country abbreviation.

   KEY_PROVINCE is an abbreviation of the state or province.

   KEY_CITY 	is the location city.

   KEY_ORG 	is the organization name.

   KEY_EMAIL	is a email address associated with these certificates.

   KEY_CN 	is your domain or subdomain.

   KEY_NAME 	set this to "server" using any other name will require 
		changes to the OpenVPN config.

   KEY_OU	is the name of the Organizational Unit to which this will 
		belong.

3. Source the vars file just edited.
     # . /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/vars

4. Run:  clean-all
     # ./clean-all

5. Run:  build-ca
     # ./build-ca
   It will prompt for confirmation of the values you set in the vars file

6. Run: build-key-server server
     # ./build-key-server server
   It will prompt for confirmation of the values you set in the vars file.
   Dont set the challenge password.
   When asked to sign the certificate answer "y".

7. Run: build-dh
     # ./build-dh

8. Copy the server files into the /opt/ibm/lsf-hybrid-clod/VPN directory
     # cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys
     # cp dh2048.pem ca.crt server.crt server.key /opt/ibm/lsf-hybrid-clod/VPN

9. Next build the client files.  Run: build-key client
     # cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
     # ./build-key client                    
   Leave the key name as client, otherwise you will need to modify the 
   Ansible playbooks.
   Dont set the challenge password.
   When asked to sign the certificate answer "y".

10. Copy the client files 
     # cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/keys
     # cp client.crt client.csr client.key /opt/ibm/lsf-hybrid-clod/VPN

11. Generate a static encryption key
     # openvpn --genkey --secret /opt/ibm/lsf-hybrid-clod/VPN/myvpn.tlsauth

That's it the keys are ready to be used.

NOTE: If the VPN server is restarted it's public IP may change.  When this happens
it is necessary to modify the /etc/openvpn/client.conf and set the new "remote"
address.
